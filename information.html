        <h2>Common Mental Health Issues in Youths:</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Depression</h3>
        <p> Depression is a mental health condition that makes people feel sad, hopeless, and uninterested in things
            they normally enjoy. It can affect how you think, feel, and act, and can make everyday tasks feel
            overwhelming.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Anxiety</h3>
        <p>Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or fear about something that might happen. It can make you feel
            uneasy or stressed, like when you're facing a big event or uncertain situations.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD)</h3>
        <p> it is a condition where people have repeated, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and feel the need to do certain
            actions or rituals (compulsions) to try to make the thoughts go away. These actions can take up a lot of
            time and make daily life harder, even though the person may know the rituals don't really help.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Schizophrenia</h3>
        <p>it is a mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and acts. People with schizophrenia
            may have trouble telling the difference between what's real and what's not, and they might hear voices or
            see things that aren't there. It can also cause confusion, trouble focusing, and unusual thoughts or
            behaviors. Treatment, like medication and therapy, can help manage the symptoms.</p>

        <h3>Bipolar disorder</h3>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood changes. People with bipolar disorder
            can have periods of very high energy and happiness (called mania) and other times when they feel very sad,
            tired, or down (called depression). These mood swings can affect a person's daily life.</p><br>

        <h3>Eating disorder</h3>
        <p>An eating disorder is a condition where a person has unhealthy thoughts and behaviors around
            food, eating, and their body. This can include things like eating too much or too little, or being very
            concerned about weight and appearance. Eating disorders can affect a person's health and emotions.</p><br>

        <h3>Hallucination</h3>
        <p>Hallucinations are when a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something that isn't
            actually there. These false experiences can happen in the mind, and the person might believe they are real,
            even
            though others don't perceive them.</p><br>

        <h3>Illusion</h3>
        <p>An illusion is when something appears to be different from what it really is. It's a false or
            misleading image or perception, like seeing something that looks bigger, smaller, or a different color than
            it
            actually is.</p><br>

            activities. Everyone with autism is different, and they may have unique strengths and challenges.</p>
        <br>
